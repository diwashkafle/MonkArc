We have used db sessions instead of jwt sessions because of these reasons: 
1.Can revoke instantly
2.Can track active sessions
3.Smaller cookie (just session ID)
4.Database query on every request (but fast with indexes) and we have fast serverless DB (neon). 

When to Use JWT:
Use JWT sessions when:
You need stateless auth (no database dependency)
You're scaling horizontally across many servers
You need extreme performance (millions of requests/sec)
You're building a microservice architecture (JWT passed between services)

Use DB sessions when:
You need instant revocation (sign out, ban user)
You need fresh session data (permissions change often)
You have a monolithic app (like MonkArc)
Database query overhead is acceptable (which it is for most apps)
