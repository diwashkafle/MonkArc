Explanation of syntax and concept used in drizzle:
1. 
(table) => [
  unique('uniqueJourneyDate').on(table.journeyId, table.date),
]
This means:

“Create a UNIQUE CONSTRAINT that applies to the combination of (journeyId, date).”

So:
	•	Two rows cannot have the same journeyId AND the same date.
	•	But same journeyId can exist many times with different dates.
	•	And the same date can exist with different journeyId.

This is called a composite unique constraint.
